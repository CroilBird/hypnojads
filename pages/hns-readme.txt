hns files are just text files where each line is some abstracted html element

any element can be anywhere in an hns file, but I usually put them in the order:

meta stuff:
title
user
background-color or background
music
[list of elements]


here's the list of elements that exist:

meta:
title: the title of the webpage. shown just under the url bar
user: the user who created the webpage. should be the same for a page and its subpages
background-color: the color applied to the entire body background. defaults to #222034
background: the style for the background. more versatile than background-color
music: the url of the music to use, relative to the root of the website directory
